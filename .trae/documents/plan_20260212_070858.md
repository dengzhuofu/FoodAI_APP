I will transform the app's UI to the requested "Sports/Competition" style by first creating a reusable design skill and then applying it to the codebase.

### Phase 1: Create Design Skill
1.  **Analyze Visual Style**: Extract key design elements from the reference images:
    -   **Color Palette**: Primary Teal/Green (`#00C896`), Dark Backgrounds, White Cards, Neon Accents.
    -   **Typography**: Bold, dynamic headers, clear body text.
    -   **Layout**: Card-based lists, distinct tab bars, gradient buttons.
2.  **Generate Skill**: Use the `skill-creator` tool to create a new skill named `sports-theme-design`.
    -   This skill will serve as the "source of truth" for the new design system.
    -   It will include specific hex codes, spacing rules, and component patterns.

### Phase 2: Apply Design System
1.  **Update Theme Configuration**: Rewrite `src/app/styles/theme.ts` to implement the new color palette and typography rules defined in the skill.
2.  **Refactor Global Styles**: Update the main application background and navigation bar styles to match the dark/teal theme.

### Phase 3: Component & Screen Transformation
1.  **Update Key Components**: Refactor `Button`, `Card`, and `TabBar` components to use the new visual style (rounded corners, shadows, gradients).
2.  **Revamp Screens**: Apply the new design to:
    -   `ExploreScreen` (Home feed)
    -   `ProfilePage`
    -   `RecipeDetailPage` (if applicable)
3.  **Verification**: Ensure the new theme renders correctly on the device/simulator (via code review and checking for compilation errors).
